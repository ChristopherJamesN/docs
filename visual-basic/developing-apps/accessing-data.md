# Accessing Data in Visual Basic Applications
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] includes several new features to assist in developing applications that access data. Data-bound forms for Windows applications are created by dragging items from the [Data Sources Window](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0d20f699-cc95-45b3-8ecb-c7edf1f67992) onto the form. You bind controls to data by dragging items from the **Data Sources Window** onto existing controls.
