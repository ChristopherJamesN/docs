# How to: Work with ActiveX Controls (Visual Basic)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

ActiveX controls are COM components or objects you can insert into a Web page or other application to reuse packaged functionality someone else has programmed. You can use ActiveX controls developed for Visual Basic 6.0 and earlier versions to add features to the **Toolbox** of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
### To add ActiveX controls to the toolbox  
  
1.  On the **Tools** menu, click **Choose Toolbox Items**.  
  
     The **Choose Toolbox** dialog box appears.  
  
2.  Click the **COM Components** tab.  
  
3.  Select the check box next to the ActiveX control you want to use, and then click **OK**.  
  
     The new control appears with the other tools in the **Toolbox**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can use the Aximp utility to manually create an interop assembly for ActiveX controls. For more information, see [Aximp.exe (Windows Forms ActiveX Control Importer)](~/docs/framework/tools/aximp-exe-windows-forms-activex-control-importer.md).
