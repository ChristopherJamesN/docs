# C# Walkthroughs
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../includes/csharpbanner.md)]

Walkthroughs give step-by-step instructions for common scenarios, which makes them a good place to start learning about the product or a particular feature area.  
  
 This section contains links to C# programming walkthroughs.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Accessing the Web by Using Async and Await](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/25879a6d-fdee-4a38-bc98-bb8c24d16042)  
 Shows how to create an asynchronous solution by using [async](../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) and [await](../csharp/language-reference/keywords/await.md), introduced in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)].  
  
 [Creating a Windows Runtime Component in C# or Visual Basic and Calling it from JavaScript](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fc3ed156-ca29-42f3-ad60-acb228812633)  
 Shows how to create a [!INCLUDE[wrt](../includes/wrt-md.md)] type, package it in a [!INCLUDE[wrt](../includes/wrt-md.md)] component, and then call the component from a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] app that's built for Windows by using JavaScript.  
  
 [Office Programming (C# and Visual Basic)](../csharp/programming-guide/interop/walkthrough-office-programming.md)  
 Shows how to create an Excel workbook and a Word document by using C# and Visual Basic.  
  
 [Creating and Using Dynamic Objects (C# and Visual Basic)](../csharp/programming-guide/types/walkthrough-creating-and-using-dynamic-objects.md)  
 Shows how to create a custom object that dynamically exposes the contents of a text file, and how to create a project that uses the `IronPython` library.  
  
 [Authoring a Component with Visual C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e7a5405d-ab47-4578-bcbf-38f6cf7ccfac)  
 Shows the development of a simple component, illustrating the interaction between client and component, object lifetime and circular references, debugging clients and components, and the use of shared methods and instance methods.  
  
 [Authoring a Composite Control with Visual C#](~/docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-authoring-a-composite-control-with-visual-csharp.md)  
 Demonstrates creating a simple composite control and extending its functionality through inheritance.  
  
 [Authoring a Simple Multithreaded Component with Visual C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7bc03b7b-d680-499b-8179-5f414b2d650c)  
 Demonstrates creating a multithreaded component, explaining how threads work and how to coordinate multiple threads in your component.  
  
 [Creating a Windows Forms Control that Takes Advantage of Visual Studio Design-Time Features](~/docs/framework/winforms/controls/creating-a-wf-control-design-time-features.md)  
 Illustrates how to create a custom designer for a custom control.  
  
 [Inheriting from a Windows Forms Control with Visual C#](~/docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-inheriting-from-a-windows-forms-control-with-visual-csharp.md)  
 Demonstrates creating a simple inherited button control. This button inherits functionality from the standard Windows Forms button and exposes a custom member.  
  
 [Debugging Custom Windows Forms Controls at Design Time](~/docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-debugging-custom-windows-forms-controls-at-design-time.md)  
 Describes how to debug the design-time behavior of your custom control.  
  
 [Performing Common Tasks Using Smart Tags on Windows Forms Controls](~/docs/framework/winforms/controls/performing-common-tasks-using-smart-tags-on-wf-controls.md)  
 Demonstrates some of the commonly performed tasks such as adding or removing a tab on a `TabControl`, docking a control to its parent, and changing the orientation of a `SplitContainer` control.  
  
 [Writing Queries in C# (LINQ)](../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries-linq.md)  
 Demonstrates the C# language features that are used to write [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] query expressions.  
  
 [Manipulating Data (C#) (LINQ to SQL)](~/docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/walkthrough-manipulating-data-csharp.md)  
 Describes a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] scenario for adding, modifying, and deleting data in a database.  
  
 [Simple Object Model and Query (C#) (LINQ to SQL)](~/docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/walkthrough-simple-object-model-and-query-csharp.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create an entity class and a simple query to filter the entity class.

 Demonstrates how to use LINQ to SQL to access data by executing only stored procedures.  
  
 [Querying Across Relationships (C#) (LINQ to SQL)](~/docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/walkthrough-querying-across-relationships-csharp.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] associations to represent foreign-key relationships in a database.  
  
 [Serializing Collections of Standard Types with the DesignerSerializationVisibilityAttribute](~/docs/framework/winforms/controls/serializing-collections-designerserializationvisibilityattribute.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the `DesignerSerializationVisibilityAttribute` class to control how a collection is serialized at design time.
